= How to use twitcurl library? =
twitcurl is an open-source pure C++ library for twitter REST APIs. Currently, it has support for most of the twitter APIs and it will be updated to support all the APIs. twitcurl uses cURL library for handling HTTP requests and responses. Building applications using twitcurl is quite easy:
  * Compile twitcurl source files (twitcurl.h and twitcurl.cpp) and link with cURL library (libcurl.lib) to build twitcurl.lib

  * Include twitcurl.h and cURL headers (present in /include/curl/ directory in cURL source)in your twitter based application and link to twitcurl.lib and libcurl.lib/libcurl.dll.

  * Instantiate an object of twitCurl class and use the twitter API wrappers that are exposed as public methods.

  * twitcurl works on all OS (Windows, Linux, Mac etc.) as it is written completely in C++ and the only dependency is cURL (which works on all OSes mentioned earlier).

=OAuth Flow:=
Refer this wiki page for OAuth flow:
http://code.google.com/p/twitcurl/wiki/TwitcurlOAuthFlow


=UNIX/Linux:=
A separate branch of twitCurl library exists for UNIX/Linux distributions. This branch contains Makefile and other changes to build the library in UNIX/Linux. The source is available here:
http://code.google.com/p/twitcurl/source/browse/#svn/branches/libtwitcurl


=Windows:=
The twitCurl.lib library that is present in the "Download" section is built using Visual C++ 6.0. If you are using a newer version of Visual C++ to build your application, then you may encounter linker errors (as mentioned here: http://code.google.com/p/twitcurl/issues/detail?id=4 ) if you link twitCurl.lib built on older Visual C++ version. To overcome these link errors, please download the source of twitCurl and build the library using your (newer) Visual C++ IDE. Later, use this newly built library to link with your application.

Note: Currently Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 workspace (dsw) file is provided with the twitcurl source. This workspace can be used to compile and build twitcurl on Windows using any of the Visual C++ applications (6.0 or later). If you are using any other Windows based C++ IDE, then you can create new "workspace" and just add twitCurl source files to this new "workspace".
